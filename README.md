Simple recording application

## What is it?

For a long time, Audacity has served well as a simple yet powerful recording application. However, in on-going efforts to keep things as simple as possible for non-technical users, I started to require customisation. I'm not about to start my own fork of the Audacity code, but putting together a basic recording program in Python, that I might do.

## What customisations are you talking about?

Primarily, I wanted to be able to remove the possibility of users starting new recordings on top of old recordings. This is more of a problem than you might think.

I have also speculated for a while about the idea of a recording program that reports the audio levels to a website, so that the recording levels can be monitored remotely, if, say, the entire screen of your computer is taken over by PowerPoint.

## So this is going to be developed further?

Maybe.
